# Sample-SPA-Backend

To Start the project, create an .env file in the Sample-SPA-Backend folder and add all the following environment variables to it:

PORT = 5000
SQL_USER = UserSQL
SQL_PASSWORD = admin1234
SQL_SERVER = localhost
SQL_DATABASE = webstore
JWT_SECRET = xsshvua3lJagsFPJ

Then type the "npm install" in the command line , I hope it downloads everything you need.

To run the Backend type in the command line "npm run dev", this to run it locally.

If you want to create a digital project build on the command line "npm run build" and then "npm run start", with that last command the backend will be started for the production build.
